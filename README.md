Through my in-universe stories, it also acts as a way for me to archive my thoughts and 
imaginations/views on the nature of universe, for story consistency reasons in frameworks of M-Theory,
but even then,
it opens up a whole new canvas to debate.
My proudest works are Gravitational Well, Conformal Computer Theory and Lagrangian Lullaby.
Unity through Spirituality between waring factions in Shan'Hal Monastery, search for inner-peace
Our planet that we kill through Speech to Humanity
Gravity weakness through Anti-de Sitter Subspace approach.

It's not only physical world, Half of my life can be said is spent in digital realm,
where i also explore scenarios, Cyberinvasion of Vishapakar
Potential of future computing in hybridised Transistor-Quantum approach
Potential near-future routing methods and protocols in Call Nearest Retransmitter First
And IPv6 as global framework of internet and identifications in Internet Protocol Global Identificators

And a world of human unity embarged in curiosity and creativity embraced by technologies United Sol Command
